# Archipelago-Manual-Randomizer-for-Ultimate-Marvel-vs.-Capcom-3-Combos
This is a manual archipelago randomizer for Ulitmate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 which only includes Training mode. It also has a different goal to the main manual, which is points based.
This Manual should take about an hour and a half to complete as of the most recent version

DISCLAIMER:

If you're on PC and you do not have a second monitor, I recommend you play in a small window, like 800x600. This is because when you're alt tabbed, UMVC3 still reads mouse input, and this mouse input can cause the game to constantly read arrow key movement, making menuing impossible.
