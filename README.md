# Archipelago-Manual-Randomizer-for-Ultimate-Marvel-vs.-Capcom-3-Combos
This is a manual archipelago randomizer for Ulitmate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 which only includes Training mode, and is about killing Thor with random characters. It also has a different goal to the main manual, which is basically a triforce hunt.

You earn items by  Dealing 1,250,000 damage with a specific character. X-Factor is allowed. There's two types of these locations: one where level 3 Hyper combos are allowed and one where they aren't allowed. 

There are three items you earn: character keys, "cool points", and damage bonuses. A character key lets you choose the character it says on the key and cool points are a bunch of win condition mcguffins. You achieve victory by obtaining 35 cool points out of a possible 45.

You start off with the medium damage setting you can choose before starting a training session, and you can earn two upgrades that, when obtained, give you the option to change the damage setting before starting a training session.

This AP world takes me about an hour and a half to complete, can be much longer / shorter depending upon your knowledge and execution.
 I am considering adding more locations in a future update where there's more conditions, like being unable to use X-factor or being unable to DHC or TAC. I am a bit concerned that this option would bloat the amount of checks greatly and would that some character combinations would cause a lot of skill BKs or even make things impossible.


DISCLAIMER:

If you're on PC and you do not have a second monitor, I recommend you play in a small window, like 800x600. This is because when you're alt tabbed, UMVC3 still reads mouse input, and this mouse input can cause the game to constantly read arrow key movement, making menuing impossible.
